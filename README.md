Scripts to allow for better productivity. Simplifies setting do not disturb in slack with a status message and emoji (hard coded for now, but might add support to change them in the future).

Pure bash-scripts are located in the [bash-folder](bash/) and scripts for the brilliant [Focus-app](https://heyfocus.com/) are located in the [Focusapp-folder](focusapp/)(unfortunately macOS only). A slack-token is needed to use these scripts. You can read about how to generate one [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens). This is a super-simple implementation, but the basics should work.

Enjoy!
